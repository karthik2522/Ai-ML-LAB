## Syllabus 📑
## Note: program 4 that is renamed as id3.py
    1.Implement A* Search algorithm. 
    
    2.Implement AO* Search algorithm.
    
    3.For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the
      Candidate-Elimination algorithmto output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent
      with the training examples.
      
    4.Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an
      appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge toclassify a new
      sample.
      
    5.Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the
      same using appropriate data sets. 
      
    6.Write a program to implement the naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored
      as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.
      
    7.Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same data set for
      clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment
      on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API in the program. 
      
    8.Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to classify the iris data set. Print
      both correct and wrong predictions. Java/Python ML library classes can be used for this problem.
      
    9.Implement the non-parametric Locally Weighted Regression algorithm in order to fit data points.
      Select appropriate data set for your experiment and draw graphs
